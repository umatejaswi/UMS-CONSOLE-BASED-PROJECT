## 🎓 Console-Based University Management System (UMS)

This is a simple **console-based Python project** that simulates a University Management System. It allows the creation and management of colleges, students, and teachers through an interactive menu-driven interface.

### 🧰 Features

- 🔹 Create and manage multiple **colleges**
- 👨‍🎓 Add and display **students** with Roll Number, Name, and Branch
- 👩‍🏫 Add and display **teachers** with Roll Number, Name, and Subject
- 🔍 **Search** for students or teachers by Roll Number within a college
- ❌ Handles invalid inputs and checks for duplicate college entries
- 🧑‍💻 Clean and modular OOP structure using Python classes and inheritance

### 🏗️ Class Structure

- `Person`: Base class for common attributes
- `Student` and `Teacher`: Derived classes from `Person`
- `College`: Contains lists of students and teachers, and provides functions for data operations

### 📌 How to Use

1. Run the script in any Python 3 environment.
2. Choose options from the menu (e.g., add college, student, or teacher).
3. View and search records within the selected college.
4. Exit safely with the menu option.
